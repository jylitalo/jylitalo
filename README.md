### Current interests:

- Public Cloud in general, even though most of my work is related to AWS
- Programming in Golang (but still using Python and Ruby for example)
- Terraform for IaC (but I've also used puppet, chef and cfengine in earlier years)
- Trying to figure blogging with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) at [my blog](https://blog.ylitalot.com/) on my freetime.

### Latest public pull requests:
- [AWS IdentityStore's DisplayName doesn't require ForceNew in terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/39416)
